# Grading
This C++ program assigns a grade based on a studentâ€™s percentage input. It uses conditional statements to categorize the grade: "Fail" for less than 50, "Pass" for 50-64, "Good" for 65-74, "Very Good" for 75-84, and "Excellent" for 85-100. If the input is over 100, an error message is displayed.
